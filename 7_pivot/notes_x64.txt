# Analysis
 - We're given an address
 - Two read() are done:
   - size 256 (at the address given previously)
   - size 64 (overflow after 40)

# Check: First line is long chain, second line pivot to it
msf-pattern_create -l 50
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab
(gdb) run # "ABCDEFGH" "Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab"
(gdb) x/s 0x7ffff7bfef10 # Previously received address
"ABCDEFGH\n"
msf-pattern_offset -l 50 -q b3Ab
[*] Exact match at offset 40

Big issue I faced with pwntools:
 - The payloads sent were read a single time, thus being only one
 - Fix: Add a wait() between both (or add "recvuntil") (or readuntil())
